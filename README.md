Micro Citation Maker

Have you ever read a meme with a fact on it and wondered if it was true? Do you hate having to dig through the interwebs just to verify a statement a meme makes? Well with Micro Citation maker you can create a tiny url style link to your very own citation page.

How will this work?

This site will run on top of WordPress. Using a combination of my own code and the code of other users plugins I will create a wordpress site that allows for the Micro Citation Maker to live up to its potential. While my end goal is to make a single plugin that will enable all the features that I plan to implement, due to time constraints the end product may be a collection of theme elements, my own code and others plugins.

What has been done so far?

Currently I have a protype built on my personal box using a combination of others plugins that allows for the basic functionality of posting a citation and recieving a tiny url style link for it. While this does not give the open source community any code to contribute to, it gives me a framework on which to start to create my custom plugin around. I have bought a domain for the final product: ucite.co. So imagine a meme with a factual statement and a citation link in the form (ucite.co/F3s7j) that points to a page that can be modified and comented on which contains the citation or group of citations for the statement made.

What is next?

I now plan to start to harvest the open source code from the plugins I am using to create my custom plugin that allows for a one click way to enable Micro Citaiton Maker on your own very own Wordpress Site.

How can you help?

I still need ideas on how to structure the citation page. Right now it is pretty boring, it is just a blog post that can be edited and commented on. I'd really like to have custom fields setup for this, but have not found a good working example of freely avalible code to do this yet.
